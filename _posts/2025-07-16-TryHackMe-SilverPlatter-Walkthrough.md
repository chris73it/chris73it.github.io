# SilverPlatter Walkthrough (Easy)

## Overview
As part of the class "Introduction to Hacking Methodology" <https://academy.simplycyber.io/courses/enrolled/2738604> 
I took these notes while hacking a machine called silver-platter:
<https://www.notion.so/Introduction-to-Hacking-Methodology-GitHub-Pages-23346f98ca3080d18194f3b09c709143#23446f98ca308031add6f8bad2bd6a29>

This is an introductory class and its difficulty is very low; still, this is the first machine that I managed to hack (with some help) and I am very proud of it, so to give back to the community, I am putting this page together. My main focus is not as much on listiong the commands I typed, but also in highlighting my train of thought while working on it.

When you look at my solution, do not get discourage because you fear you would never think about doing these things, instead consider that:
1. I have been studying hacking for 6 solid months, and so far this easy machine is all I have to show for it.
2. I used Claude AI to help me every step of the way.
3. I am a software engineer that has been working for 25 years in Silicon Valley.
4. It took me 12 days to completely solve this machine and find both flags (5 to find the first one.)
5. Since I was stuck during the privesc phase, I had to give a peek to a video in the course that essentially says "I am not gonna tell you yet how to privesc this machine, but I am going to tell you that it has something to do with the fact that tim belongs to the adm group." Sincerely, I don't know how many times I had already looked at the logs and didn't see the password, but once I knew that the solutoon HAD to be in the logs, I was finally able to see it.
