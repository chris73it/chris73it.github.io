# SilverPlatter Walkthrough (Easy)

## Overview
As part of the class "Introduction to Hacking Methodology" <https://academy.simplycyber.io/p/introduction-to-hacking-methodology> 
I took these notes while hacking a machine called silver-platter:

This is an introductory class and the difficulty of the Linux machine is fairly low; still, this is the first mtime that I have managed to hack one (with some help from one video) and I am very proud of it, so I decided to put this page together to help other students like me. My main focus is in highlighting the reasoning behind the commands, as opposed to simply listing all the required steps without justification or context.

When you look at my solution, do not get discouraged because you fear you would never think about doing some of these things, instead consider that:
1. I have been studying hacking for 6 solid months, and so far this easy machine is all I have to show for it.
2. I used Claude AI to help me every step of the way.
3. I am a software engineer that has been working for 25 years in Silicon Valley.
4. It took me 12 days to completely solve this machine and find both flags (5 days to find the first one.)
5. Since I was stuck during the privesc phase, I had to give a peek to a video in the course that essentially says "I am not gonna tell you yet how to privesc this machine, but I am going to tell you that it has something to do with the fact that tim belongs to the adm group." Sincerely, I don't know how many times I had already looked at the logs and didn't see the password, but once I knew that the solution HAD to be in the logs, I was finally able to see it; so what did I spend the last 7 days doing? In short, chasing rabbit holes, but it does not mean that it was all for nothing, in fact I believe that trying and failing is how I will eventually learn how to hack faster.
